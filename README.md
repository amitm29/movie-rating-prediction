# movie-rating-prediction
Naive Bayes Classifier for movie rating prediction based on reviews.

The dataset for this problem is a subset of the IMDB movie review dataset (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). 
Given a movie review, task is to predict the rating given by the reviewer. We have been provided with separate training and test files containing 25,000 reviews (samples) each. A review comes from one of the eight categories (class labels). Here, class label represents rating given by the user (1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10) along with the review. <br/>
We are provided four files:- <br/>
  i) Train text <br/>
  ii) Train labels <br/>
  iii) Test text <br/>
  iv) Test labels. <br/>
Text files contain one review in each line and label files contain the corresponding rating.
